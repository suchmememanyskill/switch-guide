# RCM

### **About RCM**

RCM (short for **R**e**C**overy **M**ode) is a pre-boot mode for Tegra processors that allows NVIDIA and Nintendo to send the Switch tiny programs for various internal uses. On unpatched consoles, once a payload was sent,  then quickly copied into the memory buffer behind the stack, it overflowed the memory buffer into the stack. This leads to a  "smashed stack" and unsigned code execution within a bootROM context, giving us access to nearly everything on the console. We use it here to launch Atmosph√®re.

If you choose the emuMMC path introduced later in the guide, it'll be important to disable the [Automatic Save Data Cloud](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41209) function beforehand, as well as making sure [the Switch is set as the primary console](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22453/~/how-to-change-the-primary-console-for-your-nintendo-account). <br>

      - **Q: How does the RCM exploit work on unpatched Nintendo Switch consoles?** <br>
      A: For more information, please reference [this link](https://github.com/Qyriad/fusee-launcher/blob/master/report/fusee_gelee.md). There is also a Medium article about it [here](https://medium.com/@SoyLatteChen/inside-fus%C3%A9e-gel%C3%A9e-the-unpatchable-entrypoint-for-nintendo-switch-hacking-26f42026ada0).

      - **Q: Does RCM work on patched consoles?** <br>
      A: Yes. RCM is an intended mode for all Switch consoles. The exploit is the unintended effect that only some consoles can use. Consoles with the Tegra X1+ have a completely new bootROM with no evidence of the exploit, while "patched" V1 systems have an IROM patch to the bootROM applied that effectively removes fusee-gelee as well.
