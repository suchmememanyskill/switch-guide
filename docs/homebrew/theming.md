### **Installing a theme**

!!! tip "Community Themes"
	If you want to use community made themes, for example from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NXThemes/" target="_blank">**r/NXThemes**</a> subreddit or [Themezer](https://themezer.net), you can follow the guide below to install a community provided `.nxtheme` file.

#### **What you need:**

- The latest release of [NXThemes Installer](https://github.com/exelix11/SwitchThemeInjector/releases)

#### **Instructions:**

1. Download `NXThemesInstaller.nro` and put it in `sd:/switch`.
1. Copy the `.nxtheme` files to the `themes` folder on your microSD card (It is recommended you put them into their own folders, e.g. `sd:/themes/awesome_theme/awesome.nxtheme`).
	- Create the `themes` folder on the root of your microSD card if it does not exist.
2. Boot into sysCFW/emuMMC and launch the Homebrew Menu, then launch `NXThemes Installer` *with* an internet connection.
    - NXTheme Installer will automatically download the required theme patches if it has a connection to the internet. These theme patches are required for themes to work.
	If you don't want to or don't have the ability connect to a Wi-Fi network, installing the theme patches can be done manually.
	See the instructions [here](https://github.com/exelix11/theme-patches#if-you-dont-want-to-connect-your-console-to-the-internet) on how to install them manually.
3. If you get prompted about extracting your home menu data, do so.
    - You can always do this manually via the `Extract home menu` tab in `NXTheme Installer`.
3. You should now see the main menu of `NXTheme Installer`, the `Themes` tab is where you will find your themes. To install them, press the folder name of your theme and go through each home menu section to install the desired theme for that section (e.g. going to `/awesome_theme` and selecting your theme for the specific menu you want to change, do the same for the other menus).
4. Reboot into CFW via the `Reboot` tab to see the changes.

### **Troubleshooting**
#### **My Switch crashes on boot after I installed a theme!:**

**Cause 1:** You didn't install the required theme patches for your firmware version. You can remove your installed custom theme data by navigating to `sd:/atmosphere/contents` and deleting the `01000000000001000` folder.

**Cause 2:** You didn't extract your home menu data when prompted. You can remove your installed custom theme data by navigating to `sd:/atmosphere/contents` and deleting the `01000000000001000` folder.

**Cause 3:** You installed a bad theme. You can remove them by navigating to `sd:/atmosphere/contents` and deleting the `01000000000001000` folder.

- Note: `contents` is called `titles` on Atmosphère versions 0.9.4 and below.

#### **My Switch crashes on boot after I installed a font!:**

**Cause 1:** You installed a font that was too large in file size (maximum file size being 1.9MB). You can remove your installed custom font data by navigating to `sd:/atmosphere/contents` and deleting the `0100000000000811` folder.

**Cause 2:** You installed a font that wasn't the right file type (e.g. `.otf`). You can remove your installed custom font data by navigating to `sd:/atmosphere/contents` and deleting the `0100000000000811` folder.

- Note: `contents` is called `titles` on Atmosphère versions 0.9.4 and below.

#### **The NXTheme installer crashes when I launch it:**

This is probably due to the archive bit being set on either the app or the nxthemes. This is usually the result of copying files to a microSD card via a Mac. If you are experiencing this issue, try running the archive bit fixer utility via Hekate for all files.

This can be done by booting into Hekate and going to `Tools` > `Arch bit • RCM Touch • Pkg1/2` > `Fix Archive Bit`.
