# Games cheats

### **EdiZon**

For cheats management, [EdiZon](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon) and/or [EdiZon-SE](https://github.com/tomvita/EdiZon-SE) (up to date and offers more features) are recommended. They offer support for Atmosphere's cheat engine, providing an easy way to download new cheats, as well as toggle them on or off.

#### Installation requirements:
- An archive manager like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
- The latest release of [EdiZon](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon/releases) (the `EdiZon.nro` file) or [EdiZon-SE](https://github.com/tomvita/EdiZon-SE/releases) (the `EdiZon.zip` file)

!!! note "EdiZon overlay"
    EdiZon also offers a Tesla-Menu overlay, however, the official EdiZon overlay is no longer maintained and will result in Atmosphere crashing when trying to use the EdiZon overlay on firmware version 16.0.0+.
    The maintained EdiZon overlay can be found [here](https://github.com/proferabg/EdiZon-Overlay/releases).


=== "Installation instructions (EdiZon):"
    1. Boot into Hekate and go to `Tools` > `USB Tools` > `SD Card`, then plug your Switch into your PC via USB.
    2. Your microSD card should now be accessible on your PC, open it.
    3. Put the `EdiZon.nro` in `sd:/switch`.
    4. Boot into CFW.

=== "Installation instructions (EdiZon-SE):"
    1. Boot into Hekate and go to `Tools` > `USB Tools` > `SD Card`, then plug your Switch into your PC via USB.
    2. Your microSD card should now be accessible on your PC, open it.
    3. Extract the `.zip` file to a location on your computer.
    - If your archive manager allows for it, you can also simply open the `.zip` file directly.
    4. Copy the *contents* of the (extracted) `.zip` file to the root of your microSD card.
    - **Optional:** You can verify if you've installed EdiZon-SE correctly, you should have a folder called `054e4f4558454000` (EdiZon-SE) in `sd:/atmosphere/contents` and an `EdiZon.nro` file in `sd:/switch/EdiZon`.
    5. Boot into CFW.

### **Usage instructions**

Atmosphère looks for cheats to load in the `contents` sub-folder of the `atmosphere` folder. The template it looks for is `sd:/atmosphere/contents/<title_id>/cheats/<build_id>.txt`.
You need to create the `<title_id>` folder and sub-folders manually:

- `title_id` being the title or program of a game. This is game specific and can be found on EdiZon's cheat menu (TID and BID, see the bottom of this page for a sample), [switchbrew](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Title_list/Games) and [nswdb](https://nswdb.com/).

    - **Note:** Title ID means the same thing as Program ID.

- `build_id` being the version of a game. This is game specific and can be found on EdiZon's cheat menu (BID, see the bottom of this page for a sample) Cheats can be version specific so make sure the cheats you are using are compatible with your game version.

**Note:** On Atmosphère 0.9.4 and below `contents` is called `titles`.

Once the title is launched while in Atmosphere, your cheats should be applied.

### **Preventing cheats from being enabled by default**

To prevent cheats from being enabled by default, you can change your Atmosphère configuration by following the steps below.

1. Copy `system_settings.ini` from `sd:/atmosphere/config_templates` to `sd:/atmosphere/config` if it's not already there.
2. Open the `system_settings.ini` file with a text editor and edit the line `; dmnt_cheats_enabled_by_default = u8!0x1` to `dmnt_cheats_enabled_by_default = u8!0x0`.

    - Make sure you remove the space and the semicolon "`; `" in front of `dmnt_cheats_enabled_by_default`.

By default, holding the L button while launching a game will disable any game modification.

Here the Title ID of the game (TID) is `0100646009FBE000` and the Build ID of the game (BID) is `0B9A75586BC1A6C6`. Cheats are loaded from `sd:/atmosphere/contents/0100646009FBE000/cheats/0B9A75586BC1A6C6.txt` in this example.

### **Troubleshooting**
#### **EdiZon isn't showing up when I open the Homebrew menu!:**

Assuming you've followed the installation structions successfully, this is probably due to the archive bit being set on one or more folders/files on your microSD card. This is usually the result of copying files to a microSD card via a Mac. If you are experiencing this issue, try running the archive bit fixer utility via Hekate for all files.

This can be done by booting into Hekate and going to `Tools` > `Arch bit • RCM Touch • Pkg1/2` > `Fix Archive Bit`.
