# Linux - Run payload injector without root

This section details how to add an `udev` rule to let you send a payload to your Switch without needing to use `sudo`.

The following instructions only work if you have a system that implements `udev`. Most modern distros come with `systemd` already installed, which includes a `udev` implementation.

Do the following instructions while your Switch is _not_ connected to your computer.

!!! note "For Arch Linux users:"
    The package `android-udev` includes rules that will also allow for payload injection to work without root. Do note this also allows Android specific commands such as `adb` and `fastboot` to also work without root (as is the intention of it.)

### **Option 1: Manually adding rules and group**

The following instructions are not for beginners. Only do this if you understand what you are doing.

#### **Creating a new group**

To start, we will create a new group and add ourselves to it. The group the Nintendo Switch device will be owned by on Linux will be set to this group.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Enter the following command: `sudo groupadd nintendo_switch`.
3. Enter your password when prompted.
4. Enter the following command: `sudo usermod -a -G nintendo_switch $USER`. Make sure that the `G` is capitalized!
5. Close the terminal.

#### **Adding a udev rule**

Next we're gonna add a new `udev` rule. `udev` is a device manager for the linux kernel. The rule we're gonna specify is that if the Switch is connected in `RCM`, the group the Switch belongs to will be the group we made in the previous section.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Change to the root user with the following command: `sudo -i`. Enter your password when prompted.
3. Enter the following command: `mkdir -p /etc/udev/rules.d`.
4. Enter the following command: `echo 'SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{manufacturer}=="NVIDIA Corp.", ATTRS{product}=="APX", GROUP="nintendo_switch"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/10-switch.rules`.
5. Enter the following command: `udevadm control --reload`.
6. Enter the following command: `udevadm trigger`.
7. Logout and log back in.

You should now be able to run the payload sender without having to use `sudo`.

### **Option 2: Installing a package with the rules**

These rules will actually allow _ANY_ user to access your Switch via USB, not only _your_ user.

You may just follow the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/pheki/nx-udev" target="_blank">nx-udev</a>, or if you're on Ubuntu / Debian:

1. Download <a href="https://github.com/pheki/nx-udev/releases/latest/download/nx-udev_latest_all.deb
" target="_blank">nx-udev_latest_all.deb</a>.
2. Open a terminal in the same directory as your download.
3. Run `sudo dpkg -i nx-udev_latest_all.deb` to install the package

You should now be able to run the payload injector and homebrew with USB communication without having to use `sudo`.
