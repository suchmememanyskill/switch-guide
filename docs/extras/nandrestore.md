## Restore a NAND backup to the Switch

!!! danger "Warning:" 	
	- This will reset all of your saves, games, system version and other system settings back to the point of when you made the NAND backup. Keep this in mind, as you probably don't have to restore a NAND backup unless you have bricked your Switch or want to go back online safely after using CFW.

	- If you're going to restore an old NAND which will downgrade your firmware it's best to create a second NAND backup before restoring the first one in case something goes wrong.

### What you need:
- Your `rawnand.bin` (Combined or in 15 or 30 parts)
- Your `BOOT0` and `BOOT1`
	- If you're missing any of the files above, ask for further help in the [Nintendo Homebrew](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh) Discord server.
- The <a href="https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases/" target="_blank">Hekate</a> Payload
- A microSD card larger than 32GB

### Instructions:

Before we start, check if you have a tree of folders called `backup/[8 Character NAND id]/restore` on your microSD card.

!!! warning "If you don't see a backup or [8 Character NAND id] folder on your microSD card:"
	This means you do not have a nand backup, it is highly recommended you make one as soon as possible. Follow the steps below to make one.

	1. Launch the latest Hekate payload on your Switch.
	2. Navigate to `Tools` > `Backup eMMC` > `eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1` and let it do its thing.
	3. Wait for the process to complete. When it's completed, you now have a `backup/[8 Character NAND id]/restore` folder on your microSD card. Continue with step 1 of the instructions below.

1. Enter RCM and inject the Hekate payload.
    - If you use a modchipped Switch, you can simply just turn your Switch on with the Hekate payload renamed to `payload.bin` on the root of your SD.
2. Navigate to `Tools` > `USB Tools` > `SD Card` and plug your Switch into your PC via USB.
3. Copy your `rawnand.bin` (combined or in 15 or 30 parts), `BOOT0`, and `BOOT1` to the `backup/[8 Character NAND id]/restore` folder on the microSD card.
4. Eject the `UMS` device safely from within your computer's operating system.
5. Navigate to `Tools` > `Restore eMMC`. Select `Restore eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1`. Wait for this process to complete.
6. In that same menu, select `eMMC RAW GPP` and wait for the process to complete.
    - This will generally take a long time to complete, the time it takes depends on your microSD card's specifications. (10-15 minutes is expected.)

!!! danger "If you're downgrading using your NAND backup"
	If the security version you were on before you performed the NAND restore is HIGHER than the NAND backup itself, you have to enable autoRCM to not get stuck in a boot crash.

	- Note:  This section can be disregarded for modchipped Switch users.

	A system update is considered a security version when a fuse is burned, you can check **<a href="https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Fuses#Anti-downgrade" target=blank>which versions burn fuses here</a>**.

	If you were in AutoRCM before you upgraded to a newer security version (and still were after the upgrade) you don't have to do this.

	1. In Hekate's main menu, navigate to `Tools` and go to the bottom of the page where you will find a button called `Archive bit - AutoRCM`
	2. Select the `AutoRCM` buttom and you will see `ON` written next to it. This means it is enabled.
