# Installing Linux 4 Switch

Linux 4 Switch is a sister project to Switchroot Android--it uses a similar kernel but provides a variety of Linux distributions.The available distributions at this time are:

- Ubuntu Bionic (maintained by CTCaer, the primary dev of both the L4S kernel and hekate--this is the most stable and supported distro)

- Ubuntu Jammy (maintained by theofficialgman, one of the primary devs of the L4T Megascript installer program)

- Fedora 39 (maintained by azkali, a L4S kernel developer)

- Lakka 5.x (maintianed by gavin_darkglider, a L4S kernel developer and Lakka maintainer)

To install an L4S distribution, follow the official guide starting from [0. Linux Distributions](https://wiki.switchroot.org/wiki/linux/linux-distributions).

!! tip "Looking for Arch?"
   Unfortunately, L4S Arch Linux is deprecated following an xorg ABI change that breaks compatibility with the Tegra210 BSP.
