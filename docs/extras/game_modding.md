# **Game modding with LayeredFS**

LayeredFS, a tool built into Atmosphere, allows you to (temporarily) replace a game's assets with your own, modified assets as long as you're booted into CFW.

### **Usage instructions**

Check the section below to find your mod's folder/file structure, then install your mod accordingly.

!!! note "**Checking folder/file structures**"
    * If the mod solely includes a `romfs` (and/or `exefs` folder), you will need to place that folder inside of `sd:/atmosphere/contents/<title_id>/`.
        - **Note:** The title ID folder has to be created manually in this case. This is game specific and the title ID of every game can be found on the following websites: [switchbrew](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Title_list/Games) and [nswdb](https://nswdb.com/).

    * If the mod solely includes a `contents` folder, you can simply copy that folder to `sd:/atmosphere/` on your microSD card and merge folders if prompted.

    * If the mod has the complete folder structure set up (i.e. `atmosphere/contents/<title_id>/romfs`), you can simply copy the `atmosphere` folder (likely inside of a mod's `.zip` file) to the root of your microSD card and merge folders if prompted.

!!! warning "Atmosphere 0.9.4 and below"
    **Note: On Atmosphère 0.9.4 and below, `contents` is called `titles`**

In the image below, you can see a Batman skin mod being used in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. In this example, the title ID and mod installation directory would be `sd:/atmosphere/contents/0100509005AF2000/`.

### **Additional notes**

The `romfs` folder contains modified assets in the way the game would normally read them. `romfs` stands for "romFileSystem", which is quite literally what the filesystem (folder and file structure) of the game you're modding consists of internally.</br>

If you want to disable mods on launch of a game, hold the `L` button before launching the game and launch the game normally, `L` is the default button to do this. This will disable all modifications (like cheats and mods) that you have configured for your game.

The modding process is also ***not*** the same for every game, for example:

* Modding Super Smash Bros. requires [ARCropolis](https://github.com/Raytwo/ARCropolis) and [skyline](https://github.com/skyline-dev/skyline), ARCropolis looks for mods in the `sd:/ultimate/mods` directory on your microSD card.

* Modding Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom with multiple mods requires the use of [BCML](https://github.com/NiceneNerd/BCML) or [UKMM](https://github.com/NiceneNerd/UKMM) and [TKMM](https://github.com/TKMM-Team/Tkmm) respectively.

* Animal Crossing: New Horizons requires some extra setup for mods to work. The folder that would normally be called `romfs` has to be called `romFs` and you'll need to create an empty file inside of `atmosphere/contents/01006F8002326000/romFs/System/Resource/` called `ResourceSizeTable.srsizetable`. More information on this can be found on the [ac-modding website](https://ac-modding.com/ACNH/mods.html).

### **Troubleshooting**
#### **My game crashes upon launch!**
If your game crashes during launch, hold the `L` button to see if disabling all modifications for your game solves the issue. If so, delete the most recently added mod(s) for your game.

#### **My mods aren't showing up in-game!**
Assuming you've followed the installation instructions successfully, this is probably due to the archive bit being set on one or more folders/files on your microSD card. This is usually the result of copying files to a microSD card via a Mac. If you are experiencing this issue, try running the archive bit fixer utility via Hekate for all files.

This can be done by booting into Hekate and going to `Tools` > `Arch bit • RCM Touch • Pkg1/2` > `Fix Archive Bit`.
