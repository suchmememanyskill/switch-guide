A: Once you boot into Horizon, not much. The primary things to keep in mind is that only V1 consoles support Atmosph\u00e8re's \"Reboot to Payload\" function, but modchips automatically load payloads during reboots on their own.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: What is Horizon?          A: Horizon is the name of the Switch's operating system. It is sometimes called \"HorizonNX\", because it is actually a derivative version of the Nintendo 3DS's operating system of the same name.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Why is it called Atmosph\u00e8re?          A: Atmosph\u00e8re \"runs on top of the Horizon\" operating system. Each layer of Horizon's security is referenced via the atmosphere's different layers. For example, the EL1 \"kernel\" reimplementation is called mesosph\u00e8re, while the EL3 \"TrustZone\" reimplementation is called exosph\u00e8re.  Learn more about ARM Exception Levels here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: What exactly is the \"emuMMC path,\" and why is it recommended for the microSD card to be at least 128GB for this path?          A: The purpose of an emuMMC/emuNAND is to give you a safe place to use custom firmware functions without Nintendo catching sight. As it is an offline clone of your internal storage ran entirely from your microSD card, you will need to set allocate up to 64GB on your microSD card for it (depending on the size of your internal storage), plus a duplicate your of digital game data (emuMMC uses a separate Nintendo folder for game installs).</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Why do I need to set my console as primary before starting this guide?          A: The Switch will otherwise try to connect to Nintendo servers before starting apps, which can lead to unexpected delays and make emuMMCs completely unusable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Can I follow this guide if I have a smaller microSD card, and what are the risks involved in choosing the sysNAND CFW path?          A: Nothing stops you from using CFW on your sysNAND, but it is recommended for first-timers to get familiar with CFW by starting with an emuMMC. Running CFW on sysNAND can risk bricking your console's internal system software, stopping it from turning on even without starting the console via RCM or from your modchip. It also risks bans.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Are there any specific restrictions or limitations imposed by Nintendo on consoles running custom firmware and homebrew?          A: Nintendo has shown a distinct tolerance for users using CFW while online. They do not ban for the presence of CFW, they ban for misbehavior - such as piracy or cheating online. Otherwise, you are treated like all other users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Is there any community support or forums recommended for users who may have questions or issues during the process?          A: Of course! As well as the Nintendo Homebrew Discord server, you can also try the r/SwitchHacks subreddit!</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/","title":"About","text":""},{"location":"about/#about-this-guide","title":"About this guide","text":"<p>This guide was written by community members of the Nintendo Homebrew Discord Server.</p> <p> </p> <p>Credits</p> <ul> <li>SuchMemeManySkill</li> <li>DefenderOfHyrule</li> <li>ha1vorsen</li> <li>Dardel</li> <li>MarigoldZephyrNio</li> <li>Sanras</li> <li>JeffVi</li> <li>eip618</li> <li>Flump</li> <li>oreo639</li> <li>thedax</li> <li>dorkeline</li> <li>ihaveahax</li> <li>PhazonicRidley</li> <li>xGhostBoyx</li> <li>jerbear64</li> <li>Phoenix</li> <li>the Nintendo Homebrew community</li> </ul> <p>Thank you to everyone else that contributed to the guide on GitHub, but special thanks to noirscape.</p> <p>You can find this guide on GitHub, It is licensed under the ISC license.</p> <p>Developer / Tool credits</p> <ul> <li>Atmosphere-NX for Atmosphere.</li> <li>switchbrew for nx-hbloader and nx-hbmenu.</li> <li>nwert and CTCaer for Hekate.</li> <li>WerWolv for EdiZon.</li> <li>J-D-K for JKSV.</li> <li>Flagbrew for Checkpoint.</li> <li>mtheall for FTPD.</li> <li>joel16 for NX-Shell.</li> <li>Cease &amp; DeSwitch for fusee-gelee.</li> <li>MenosGrante for Rekado.</li> <li>eliboa for TegraRcmGUI.</li> <li>vgmoose, pwsincd, rw-r-r_0644 and crc32 for hb-appstore.</li> <li>Essometer for collecting patched Switch serials.</li> <li>Ave for 90DNS.</li> <li>Nexrem (meganukebmp) for the Switch 90DNS Tester.</li> <li>exelix11 for Switch Theme Injector.</li> <li>suchmememanyskill for TegraExplorer</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"faq/","title":"FAQ","text":""},{"location":"faq/#what-firmware-versions-are-currently-hackable","title":"What firmware versions are currently hackable?","text":"<p>Currently two hardware revisions of the Switch exist. Any Switch bought or manufactured before the middle of 2018 has a bootrom bug that allows us to run code regardless of the firmware version on the Switch. When Nintendo updates the system, however, CFW will usually need an update to account for it. This bug cannot be fixed by Nintendo once the console leaves the factory, unless the console is sent in for repairs. This means that all current and future firmwares will be able to launch CFW through this exploit on the old hardware revision.</p> <p>Any console purchased after approximately August 2018 is likely to be patched. This includes the latest units on shelves, referred to as 'red box' or 'Mariko'.     Mariko is hardware patched, but may come on a vulnerable firmware. Currently the only way to know if your Switch is hackable is by trying to send the payload in RCM. Even with this exploit fixed, many Switch consoles on 8.0.1 and below will be hackable to some degree in the future (see Should I update my Firmware? for much more detailed information). The serial number on the back of the box can possibly tell you which consoles are patched and which aren't. See here for an up to date list.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#how-do-i-use-the-exploit-how-can-i-boot-into-rcm","title":"How do I use the exploit? How can I boot into RCM?","text":"<p>To launch CFW through the exploit, the Switch needs to be in \"Recovery Mode\"(RCM). The easiest way to enter RCM is by grounding pin 10 in the right joycon rail and holding VOL+ on boot. Several methods and designs to do this exist, see our guide for more information. Once the Switch is in RCM it needs to be connected to either a computer, phone or dongle to send the exploit and the payload.</p> <p>This procedure needs to happen every time the Switch boots from a completely \"off\" state, otherwise the Switch will boot into the stock firmware.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#what-makes-a-good-jig-good-can-i-use-a-paperclip","title":"What makes a good jig good? Can I use a paperclip?","text":"<p>Most people prefer to use 3d-printed jigs to enter RCM. These jigs are made in a way that they slide into the right joycon rail and have a piece of connected wire that then bridges pin 10 and one of the grounded pins on the Switch. A lot of different designs for these jigs exist, but it is important to understand, that these jigs can damage the Switch if they are made in a bad way.</p> <p>Since the wire in the jig is supposed to touch the pads inside the Switch's joycon rail, it is important to use wire that is thin, not rigid and bent/not pointy. Paperclips make for potentially dangerous jigs, as they are made out of a hard material, are rigid and pointy and can easily scratch off the pads inside the Switch. A good jig uses 32Gauge(0.2mm diameter) wire and is bent in a way that the end of the wire does not scratch the pads. You can download and 3d-print your own jig and use the pictures on this website to guide you on how to bend the wire correctly. Premade jigs can be found on online marketplaces for cheap.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#is-there-an-easier-way-to-enter-rcm","title":"Is there an easier way to enter RCM?","text":"<p>To enter RCM more comfortably a solution called \"AutoRCM\" exists. Once set up, this method will always boot the Switch into RCM, even without a jig or holding any buttons. This works by \"bricking\" the Switch in a controlled manner. The Switch detects that something is wrong and boots into RCM to get repaired. The big downside of this method is, that it is impossible to boot the Switch without a computer, phone or dongle, as it will never boot into stock firmware by itself, and that it requires an SD card with the proper CFW files on it at all times. In addition, if the battery of the Switch is completely drained, the Switch will need to charge to at least 10% in Hekate before launching Atmosphere, otherwise the Switch will refuse to boot due to the low battery. Charging in RCM is not recommended as this is very slow. AutoRCM can be reversed, but it is advised to keep a working NAND and BOOT0/1 backup before using it.</p> <p>Many Android-phones are able to send the exploit to the Switch, making them a perfect portable way to launch CFW. Different designs for portable dongles exist, ranging from Raspberry Pi Zero and Arduino projects to internal dongles, that work completely autonomous. The latter should only be done by advanced users, as it requires soldering onto the Switch mainboard itself.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#should-i-update-my-firmware","title":"Should I update my Firmware?","text":"<p>If your Switch is one of the new hardware revisions that patched the exploit in RCM and you are on firmware 7.0.1 or lower, you should not update if you want to have CFW in the forseeable future.</p> <p>If your Switch is one of the older hardware revisions and you don't mind having to use jigs/hardmods/AutoRCM and sending the exploit via computer, phone or dongle everytime you want to launch into CFW then it is completely safe to update. If you want the chance to maybe, one day, not have to use a external device, then it is recommended to stay on a FW as low as possible. Beware that this means that you potentially need to wait for a very long time (months to years) for this to happen, if ever. Private exploits to launch CFW over the Browser are known to exist for firmwares up to 7.0.1.</p> <p>Downgrading on the Switch is possible, but it requires using AutoRCM and a custom bootloader payload to bypass the Switch's several hardware anti-downgrade mechanisms. This will not work on an unpatched system, and is practically useless for most users. On every boot the Switch firmware checks how many e-fuses have been burned and how many e-fuses the Switch expects to be burned. Major updates to the Switch, or updates in which a large vulnerability has been patched, irreversibly burn one of the Switch's 64 \"e-fuses\". If the Switch ever detects that more e-fuses have been burned than expected (meaning a downgrade happened), it will refuse to boot. Replacing e-fuses is not an option. You can find more information about fuses here Atmosph\u00e8reis maintained to support the latest firmware updates on unpatched units. The situation for patched and new units is as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>\"Old\" Patched Switch (HAC-001): Do NOT update past 7.0.1. Units on 7.0.1 and below will eventually get CFW. Patched units that have upgraded to 8.0.0 or 8.0.1 will likely get homebrew.</p> </li> <li> <p>\"New\" Switch (HAC-001(-01): Do NOT update past 8.0.1. Units on 8.0.1 and below will likely get homebrew. Units on 8.1.0 and higher are not expected to be hacked and can be updated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Switch Lite (HDH-001): Do NOT update past 8.0.1. Units on 8.0.1 and below will likely get homebrew. Units on 8.1.0 and higher are not expected to be hacked and can be updated.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A method to update without burning e-fuses exists, but, like downgrading, it forces you to use AutoRCM and sending the exploit via USB every time, as booting into the stock firmware even once would instantly burn the e-fuse. Note that other anti-downgrade mechanisms exist, making it for example impossible to boot game carts on a firmware below 4.1/9.0.0 if the Switch has ever launched a game on firmware 4.1+/9.0.0+. This can only be worked around by completely disabling the game cart slot while on 4.1/9.0.0 or greater, which is similarly impractical for most users.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#is-it-safe-to-use-homebrew-will-i-get-banned","title":"Is it safe to use homebrew? Will I get banned?","text":"<p>The Switch comes with a lot of telemetry, and has been called a \"telemetry monster\" by several prominent developers. As long as the Switch is connected to the internet, Nintendo gets a report about a lot of different actions and states and has the option to log or act on them. Even if the Switch is offline and connects to the internet at a later point, Nintendo still recieves information about what happened while the Switch was disconnected.</p> <p>To disable some of this telemetry, it is advised to disable the sending of error reports in the System Settings of the Switch. Additionally if you live in the EU you can set the \"do not share\" option on Nintendo's website to prevent your Switch from sending a lot of telemetry, although the effectiveness of this is questionable.</p> <p>Nintendo still receives a lot of information, even with those options disabled. We also cannot know if Nintendo decides to look for something in the logs and ban people in retrospect. They have also shown to expand their telemetry options with every other firmware update.</p> <p>Currently all bans have been for very obvious and intrusive actions, specifically:</p> <ul> <li>Developers using their unique Switch data to poke and reverse-engineer Nintendos Server responses</li> <li>People pirating games and using them online</li> <li>People changing their profile pictures to custom pictures</li> <li>People using savegame editors to unlock content that is not available yet and using it online (Splatoon 2)</li> <li>People cheating online in general (Modifying Cart stats in MK8)</li> <li>People installing homebrew NSP files, which Nintendo can pick up on with their telemetry</li> </ul> <p>Atmosph\u00e8re stops some, but not all of Nintendo's telemetry, and prevents crash reports from being sent. This means Nintendo can't tell if anything, including homebrew or modded games crashed, and Atmosph\u00e8re dumps the crash log to the microSD card to help homebrew developers. However, Nintendo still receives information about what is being played, and general system report information.</p> <p>Atmosph\u00e8re is not a silver bullet, and this does not mean that Nintendo won't decide to ban people for harmless homebrew in the future. If you are scared to get banned then don't use homebrew for now. Atmosph\u00e8re now supports emuMMC (emuNAND): a copy of Switch system software, run entirely from the microSD card instead. This erases ban risks due to the fact that emuMMC is run in a quarantined, offline state, not touching the internal memory. You are still able to boot into original firmware to play online.</p> <p>For patched units reliant on deja-vu, sysNAND will always have to be on a firmware below 4.1. For Switch versions from 5.0 to 7.0.1 deja-vu isn't quite out yet but will come eventually. (Also please note that firmwares 8.0.0+ will never work with deja-vu) You can use an updated emuMMC dedicated to online/clean play, while your sysNAND is used offline for custom firmware.</p> <p>We do not recommend the use of ReiNX or SX OS for many reasons, primary among them that they use lots of assets from Atmosph\u00e8re and offer no real benefit that Atmosph\u00e8re does not offer anyway. We also do not recommend Kosmos, as its large amount of extras on top of regular Atmosph\u00e8re make it difficult to troubleshoot strange issues. All of these alternative CFWs also tend to use non-conventional setups which can cause issues that make it difficult to troubleshoot, which is another reason we prefer using Atmosphere. Additionally, it is advised to use 90DNS which blocks connections to any Nintendo servers. If you use an emuNAND for CFW and keep your sysNAND clean for playing online, you should use 90DNS on your emuNAND. Note: Keeping your emuNAND \"dirty\" and your sysNAND \"clean\" pertains primarily to those using the RCM exploit.

This can be enabled by following the guide here.</li> <li>Atmosph\u00e8re: The CFW developed by the Atmosphere-NX organization on GitHub and the one used in this guide.</li> <li>AutoRCM: A method that corrupts parts of your boot0 and boot1, causing the Switch to boot into RCM automatically. Using this requires an additional peripheral (such as a computer, phone, dongle, or modchip) to be able to boot your Switch.</li> <li>boot0 and boot1: Two partitions of the Switch NAND.</li> <li>bootROM: An initial system loader whose primary purpose is to initialise a device's hardware and prepare it for use. It is also typically responsible for authenticating hardware and software necessary to start the device. A bootROM is a ROM, meaning that it is etched into the device and cannot be rewritten or upgraded without replacing the hardware entirely.</li> <li>CFW: Short for custom firmware. CFW is a collection of patches which partially or largely modify the functionality of the underlying OS. It is not used to refer to the usage of brand new operating systems entirely.</li> <li>Deja Vu: An unreleased exploit chain for the Nintendo Switch. The completely unpatched version of this chain will grant access to TrustZone, which effectively means being able to enter CFW. The TrustZone part of this exploit was patched in firmware version 5.0.0 and up, but normal homebrew access can still be gained up to firmware version 6.0.1.</li> <li>DNS: Domain Name System. Basically, the internet's addressbook. If you visit a website, the DNS lookup is what tells you what server the site is hosted on.</li> <li>Dongle: Device you can plug in the USB-C of your Switch to automatically send a payload if your Switch is in RCM.</li> <li>Encryption keys: Keys used to encrypt data from the Nintendo Switch.</li> <li>BIS keys: Built-in Storage keys. They are used to encrypt/decrypt the NAND's contents.</li> <li>fusee-gelee/ShofEL2: Two names for two different implementations of the same exploit. This is an exploit that grants full bootROM access to the Nintendo Switch from the Tegra X1's RCM, and permitting us to run CFW. This exploit requires an external device or a tiny hardware modification. fusee-gelee is developed by an ex-ReSwitched developer, while ShofEL2 is developed by the failoverfl0w team. This guide uses fusee-gelee.</li> <li>hactool: Software used to decrypt Nintendo Switch files like .XCI and .NSP files.</li> <li>Hekate: A bootloader for the Nintendo Switch. The current guide uses this in combination with essential files from Atmosph\u00e8re to boot CFW.</li> <li>Homebrew: Unsigned code that can be ran on the Nintendo Switch. Examples of homebrew include save editors, emulators and ports of PC games, but can also include completely original games. To run this code, you need to have an exploit.</li> <li>Homebrew launcher: Software developed by the Switchbrew team that lets you run other Homebrew.</li> <li>Jig: Refers to a piece of hardware that you can put in the Joycon rail to enter RCM.</li> <li>KIP: Short for Kernel Initial Process. These files can be loaded in when the Switch boots in CFW and provide additional functionality.</li> <li>NAND: Referred to as \"Internal Storage\" within Nintendo's consoles, this is the storage chip that the console saves the system software and internal settings to. The name refers to the type of logic gate employed, known as \"not-AND\" in this case.</li> <li>nx-hbloader: Intermediary program used to load the Homebrew Launcher from CFW developed by Switchbrew. Comes bundled with Atmosphere.</li> <li>PRODINFO: A partition on the NAND of your Switch. This along with boot0 and boot1 is the only part of your Switch that can render it unbootable if improperly modified. Atmosph\u00e8re backs up this partition on booting and it is included in your NAND backup.</li> <li>qLaunch: This is similar to the HOME Menu on the Nintendo 3DS. It serves as a launcher for many applets such as System Settings, the main home menu (ResidentMenu), User/Friends Page (myPage), Lock Screen (Entrance), News menu (Notification), and so on.</li> <li>ReSwitched: A hacking team that is one of the main developers for Atmosph\u00e8re.</li> <li>RCM: A shorthand for \"Recovery Mode\". When talking about hacking the Switch, this commonly refers to the Recovery Mode in the Tegra X1 chip that is included in the Nintendo Switch. Can be entered by holding down the Tegra X1 home button. This button is not the same as the home button on the joycons. Ways of pressing this button can be found here.</li> <li>ROM: \"Read-only memory\"; a section of data that cannot be modified once it is written.  Some forms of ROM can be rewritten under very specific scenarios, such as EEPROM (electronically-erasable/programmable ROM).</li> <li>TegraRCMGUI/fusee-interface-tk: Software used to run the fusee-gelee exploit on the Switch.</li> <li>Stock: \"Stock\" generally refers to the original factory operation or state of something.  For example, stock firmware means the original operation of Horizon, not using CFW.</li> <li>Tegra X1: A chip made by Nvidia that is used in the Nintendo Switch.</li> <li>Trinket: A category of modchip that is soldered on the Switch motherboard to automatically send a payload if it is in RCM. They are not necessarily always the Trinket brand, as this refers to the category of modchip.</li> <li>TrustZone: The highest security level on the Switch.</li> <li>XCI/NSP: Format used to dump games to. XCI is used for gamecard dumps, while NSP is for dumping digital titles.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/glossary/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<p>The resources below are for users and developers interested in developing Homebrew or for those that want to get a more technical understanding of the various concepts.</p> <ul> <li>The ReSwitched FAQ lists a general overview of how the Switch works.</li> <li>Switchbrew is a wiki detailing the inner workings of the Nintendo Switch's firmware.</li> <li>libNX documentation.

A: To our knowledge, there hasn't been a single console which has disproved the trends documented here.

A: By default, the homebrew menu and its apps inherit the resources of the Album applet. Applets don't have as many system resources as full apps, and as such have inconsistent behavior when used for homebrew purposes. Title takeover ensures the best performance, and is required for some homebrew.</li> <li>Q: Why is the \"New\" Switch (HAC-001(-01) not vulnerable to d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and what are the implications for Switch Lite (HDH-001) and OLED Switch consoles?

There is always a risk of your Switch being rendered dysfunctional when messing with its hardware without proper experience. The NH-Discord server is not for fixing bad modchip installations.

A: Modchip firmwares indirectly determine the functionality of your system. Modern modchips (such as Picofly) typically have firmware flashed to them that support all hardware configurations (namely eMMC brands like Hynix, Samsung and Toshiba) \"out-of-the-box\" and also allow you to bypass <code>sdloader</code>. If this is not the case however, flashing the firmware manually is required by opening up the Switch and using the USB debug port that comes with the modchip to flash the modchip directly. This is especially required in the cases where the eMMC brand is not supported, as your Switch wouldn't boot whatsoever and the modchip would be stuck while trying to glitch/train and write its payload to the <code>BOOT0</code> partition of the internal storage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: What different types of modchips are there?          A: There are three main types of modchips for the Nintendo Switch. Only two of them are relevant for this guide.         On the V1 Nintendo Switch, a chip can be installed which automatically injects a payload whenever the console is detected in RCM. This type of modchip is not supported by this guide.         On all other Switch consoles, there are DIY \"Picofly\" modchips which can be created with Raspberry Pi parts and custom cables. These use special firmwares, and are not compatible with firmwares intended for other modchips.         There are also other \"commercial\" modchips of dubious origin by the name of \"hwfly\" or \"SX Core/Lite\"; we only will help with flashing new firmwares onto these, if you happen to already have one of them installed. Do not ask for assistance installing or sourcing this type of modchip.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: Can you further explain the concept of running homebrew \"over a title\" and why it allows for higher resource allocation?          A: The default way to run homebrew within Atmosph\u00e8re is via the Album applet on the HOME Menu. However, applets have significantly less resources compared to full applications, and homebrew tools often run into constraints with these limits. By holding a button while launching normal apps while in CFW, you can load the Homebrew menu in their stead with full resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Q: What makes Picofly the only supported modchip, and what are the potential risks associated with installing a modchip on your Switch without proper experience?          A: Picofly is a fully open-source modchip, from the firmware to the RP2040 microcontroller it uses. Other \"commercial\" modchips have dubious origins, or were manufactured by established illegal piracy groups that have no place in the homebrew community. For the safety of your console and to respect the law of where NH Server is based, we will not assist with sourcing these types of modchips.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"user_guide/modchip/preparing_hekate/","title":"Preparing Hekate","text":""},{"location":"user_guide/modchip/preparing_hekate/#payload-and-bootloader-folder-placement","title":"Payload and bootloader folder placement","text":"<p>To get ready for formatting and/or partitioning your microSD card, we will need to prepare your it with the required files.</p>"},{"location":"user_guide/modchip/preparing_hekate/#what-you-need","title":"What you need:","text":"<ul> <li>The latest release of Hekate (Download the <code>hekate_ctcaer_(version).zip</code> release of Hekate)</li> <li>Your microSD card</li> </ul>"},{"location":"user_guide/modchip/preparing_hekate/#instructions","title":"Instructions:","text":"<ol> <li>Extract the Hekate <code>.zip</code> to a location on your computer.</li> <li>Insert your microSD card into your computer.</li> <li>Inside of the extracted Hekate folder, you will find <code>/bootloader</code> and <code>hekate_ctcaer_(version).bin</code></li> <li>Copy the <code>bootloader</code> folder and <code>hekate_ctcaer_(version).bin</code> payload to the root of your microSD card.</li> <li>Rename the <code>hekate_ctcaer_(version).bin</code> payload to <code>payload.bin</code></li> <li>Copy the <code>Nintendo</code> folder from the root of your microSD to a safe space on your device.</li> <li>Insert your microSD card back into your Switch, then turn it on.</li> <li>You should now be loaded into the Hekate GUI (Nyx), pictured below, within seconds. <ul> <li>If you are unable to load into Nyx, consult the warning message below.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Warning</p> <p>If your Switch does not load into the Hekate GUI, or shows a <code>NO SD</code>/<code>No Payload</code> screen when turning on the console, ensure that you inserted your microSD card and that Hekate's <code>payload.bin</code> is on the root of the microSD card.</p> <p>Continue to choosing your CFW environment </p> Frequently Asked Questions about this page <p>Q: Can I use a microSD card with existing data, or does it need to be formatted specifically for this process?

A: Hekate is a polished, multi-purpose bootloader for the Switch. It has the tools to facilitate simple usage of custom firmware and custom operating systems, and aids with organisation and formatting later on in this guide. </p> <p>Q: How do you pronounce \"Hekate\"?   A: Hekate comes from Greek. The most commonly accepted pronunciations are \"HEK-ate\", \"HEK-uh-tee\", and \"hek-AH-tay\".</p> <p>Q: What role does the <code>/bootloader</code> folder play in the overall functionality of Hekate?   A: The bootloader folder contains crucial parts of Hekate that can't fit in the injectable RCM/modchip payload, such as Nyx; Hekate's touch-enabled GUI. If you start Hekate without these files on your microSD, Hekate's functionality will be severely limited.</p> <p>Q: How often should I check for updates to Hekate, and what benefits do newer releases bring to the process?   A: Nintendo Homebrew's #announcements channel will automatically poll for updates to Atmosph\u00e8re and Hekate, letting you know when updates are available for them. In general, you'll want to look for updates whenever a major Switch system update is launched, as major updates will stop Horizon from booting until Hekate and Atmosph\u00e8re are updated accordingly.</p> <p>Q: Does this process have any effect on the Switch's system or data?
